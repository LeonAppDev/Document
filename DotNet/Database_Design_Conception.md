# RDBS
## A general conception
   The whole system is consisted of several tables, considered as entity set or data set. each Data set has a primary key and 0 or several foreign, primary is unique for each entity, and a foreign key is associated with a entity set in another table. So when design a database table, first you need to read through the user operation document and decide the number of tables first, and then decide columns in each table, then decide primary key for each table and then foreign key and constraint.
