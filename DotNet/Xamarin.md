# Xamarin.ios
## Get started
### Set up Visual studio development platform
#### System requirement
  In the past, we need at least a Mac as a server to run iOS app on emulator as well as a real device when using Xamarin, but for now we could use Xamarin Live Player to test our iOS app. So for now we need at least install below app
  1. Visual Studio(Community version at least)
  2. Xamarin.ios
  For now mobile development has already been a component of Visual Studio 2017, so for new installation, just select mobile development with .NET selection. If already installed, run installation program again and choose modify, select module mentioned above if not installed.
