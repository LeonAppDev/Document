# Web site visit speed optimization
## Page cache
   For wordpress website, you could cache the page from server side , in this way, when page content doesn't change and customer visit the website, sever could directly attract the content of website from the cache and do not need to run PHP logic and construct the whole web page again.

    But one thing need to be considered is if you change the logic of php and want to see the effect on this website, you need to wait until the cache expired.
