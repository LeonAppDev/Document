# HTML analysis
## tag
  HTML tag and attributes all use small alphabetic and attributes and styles with two words usually connect with '-', a arrtiburs has more than one value, split with ',' or ';'
  1. Difference between div and span
  div is a kind of block element, it will start a new line no matter the width of document in it. On the other hand span is an inline tag, it will only takes as much width as necessary.
  2. Html <table> is suitable for changing text, I think for layout with index and text, it is better than using list with <ul>and <li>
   ```html
   <table>
     <tr><td>1</td><td>some text</td><tr>
   </table>
   ```
   is better than
   ```html
   <ul>
     <li>
       <span>1<span>some text
     </li>
   </ul>
   ```
   3. <i> tag
   <i> mean text enclosed in will use italic style. It is similiar with <em>, <strong>, <mark>, <cite> and <dfn> which could respresent different style of text.
   4. inline element and block element
   inline tag will not change any position of element inside it whole block element wrap other element
